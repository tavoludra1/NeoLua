# NeoLua

**Building Neural Networks from Scratch in Lua**

Welcome to NeoLua, a project dedicated to exploring the world of artificial intelligence by implementing neural networks using only the Lua programming language. 

**Project Goals:**

* **Deep Dive into Neural Networks:** Gain a profound understanding of neural networks by building them from the ground up, without relying on external libraries.
* **Lua Mastery:**  Enhance your Lua programming skills by tackling a complex and challenging project.

**Key Features:**

* **Pure Lua Implementation:**  No external libraries or dependencies, just the power of Lua.
* **Git Flow Workflow:**  Adhering to best practices for version control and collaboration.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  Clear explanations, code comments, and commit messages to facilitate understanding.
* **Incremental Development:**  Starting with fundamental concepts and gradually building towards more complex neural network architectures.

**Roadmap:**

* **Fundamentals:** Implement perceptrons, activation functions, and backpropagation.
* **Multi-layer Perceptrons:** Build and train simple multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).
* **Advanced Architectures:** Explore CNNs, RNNs, and other advanced neural network architectures.
* **Optimization and Regularization:**  Implement techniques like gradient descent, Adam, dropout, and weight decay.
